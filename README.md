## Introduction

This repository contains various small-to-medium-sized Vanilla JavaScript projects that I have completed during my journey as a developer. The projects showcase my understanding of core JavaScript concepts, DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous programming, and more. Each project focuses on a specific topic or problem, helping me deepen my knowledge and practical application of JavaScript.

## Projects

Here is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1**: [Keyboard Code]
   - Description: Shows keyboard code when pressed.
   - Insights:  I learned event handling during this project.
2. **Project 2**: [Github User Search]
   - Description: Can look up github users.
   - Insights:  I learned fetch api and error handling.

   ...

Feel free to explore each project folder to learn more about its details and dive into the source code.

## Learning Journey

My journey as a developer has been a continuous learning experience. With each project, I have encountered new challenges, found creative solutions, and deepened my understanding of JavaScript. Some of the key insights and skills I gained throughout this journey include:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Understanding how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the content and structure of web pages.

- **Event Handling**: Learning to handle user interactions and respond to events such as clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.
- 
- *Asynchronous Programming*: Exploring asynchronous concepts using Promises, async/await, and callbacks to manage network requests and time-dependent operations.

- *Web APIs*: Utilizing various browser APIs like LocalStorage, Fetch API, and others to enhance web applications.

- *ES6+ Features*: Embracing modern JavaScript features to write cleaner, more efficient code, including arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring.

- *Project Organization*: Structuring projects with clear separation of concerns and modularizing code for maintainability.

- *Debugging*: Gaining proficiency in debugging techniques to identify and fix errors in code effectively.

- *Performance Optimization*: Learning strategies to improve website performance, such as reducing load times and optimizing rendering.

## How to Run the Projects
